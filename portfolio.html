		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>In "Pixel Knight," you are a pixelated knight. The scoring is based on <br>
		how long you can last without taking damage or "game-ending". Randomness can <br>
		be found in the frequency of fireballs being shot. The game progresses in difficulty <br>
		every level. The game ends when you lose all three lives.	
		</p>
		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>"Pixel Knight" was inspired by my love of platformer games and retro games. <br>
		Points of success in "Pixel Knight" were when I achieved jumping and platforms. <br>
		Two obstacles faced by "Pixel Knight" were platforming and time, but I was able <br>
		to overcome both. If I had more time or resources on this project, I would add <br>
		an actual storyline and more levels to my game.</p>
		<h2>Significant Algorithm</h2>
		<img src="yikers.PNG" alt="algorithm">
		<p>It is an algorthm because it executes that command whenever certain requirements are met. <br>
		It works whenever the main sprite touches those colours. Whenever you touch those colors <br>
		the game makes you take damage and the score resets.</p>
