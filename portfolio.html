		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>In "Pixel Knight," you are a pixelated knight. The scoring is based on <br>
		how long you can last without taking damage or "game-ending". Randomness can <br>
		be found in the frequency of fireballs being shot. The game progresses in difficulty <br>
		every level. The game ends when you lose all three lives.	
		</p>
		<h2>Reflection</h2>
		<p>"Pixel Knight" was inspired by my love of platformer games and retro games. <br>
		Points of success in "Pixel Knight" were when I achieved jumping and platforms. <br>
		Two obstacles faced by "Pixel Knight" were platforming and time, but I was able <br>
		to overcome both. If I had more time or resources on this project, I would add <br>
		an actual storyline and more levels to my game.</p>
		<h2>Significant Algorithm</h2>
		<img src="yikers.PNG" alt="algorithm">
		<p>It is an algorthm because it executes that command whenever certain requirements are met. <br>
		It works whenever the main sprite touches those colours. Whenever you touch those colors <br>
		the game makes you take damage and the score resets.</p>

		<h1 id="CYOA">3 Little Gremlins</h1>
		<p>The player can take the point of view as one of three gremlins who attempt to journey far <br>
		from their mother's home. They make choices in a twisted version of the classic "The 3 Little Pigs".<br>
		It's a choose-your-own-adventure story where the user faces frequent obstacles in their journey to find a <br>
		place to call home.</p>

		<p><center> The incremental and iterative development processes of my program include the use of Google Drawings in order to sequentially develop the <br>
		scenes of my story and the use of functions in order to isolate each scene in Python. Google Drawings was used to plan each scene and label the order<br>
		the user would have to follow in order to reach an ending. In Python, each function would be its own individual scene and could branch out to other <br>
		functions. We would then run the program and attempt to reach each ending. The isolation of each function meant that we would have to run each function<br>
		in order to read any error messages. If any were found (many due to simple mistakes such as forgetting a quotation mark), the function would have to be revised.<br>
		It was difficult to enable the user to have enough control over the story without making the story unnecessarily complex, so we attempted to compromise with as <br>
		many decisions as possible. <br>
		<br>
    	The organization of scenes of my story is a form of procedural abstraction because the functions can be diverted into multiple scenes. The advantages of abstracting<br>
    	your scenes into functions are that each scene is isolated from one another allowing for easy manipulation of each individual scene: being able to remove or add as many<br>
    	scenes as possible without disrupting the flow of the story. <br>
    	<br>
    	Two stories that I enjoyed were Natan's Adventure to Varsity due to its RPG aspect and World War Two simulator because of the routes that we could've taken.</p></center>
